Hi,

I'm applying for the Unity gameplay engineer position. Working for Telltale games would be my dream job, as one of my lifelong aspirations is to create a game with narratives that are as powerful as any found in a novel or movie. I've played the Walking Dead, the Sam and Max series (including the original by Lucasarts!), and upteen other games and RPGs, and I would be absolutely thrilled to help make a Telltale game.

I consider myself a story writer/software engineer with solid technical chops. I have an educational background in Applied Math/CS, with a strong foundation in algorithms and computer graphics. I've worked in the software industry for many years in various industries, but I've always made solid contributions to the teams I've worked for...always wearing many hats and interfacing with many a variety of teams to get the job done. Most recently I helped release a Unity Game to IOS and Android, acting as the lead engineer and working on all parts of the game's subsystems. I've also done some hobby game and graphics programming on the side, diving deep into the internals of a game engine. I am a fast learner, passionate about game programming and storytelling, and believe I could really knock the ball out of the park in terms of helping Telltale create an awesome game with powerful narratives.

Looking forward to chatting with you about the position, at your convenience.

Best Regards,
Edward Cheung
