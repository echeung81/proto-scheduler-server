When do we initialize?

When we open up the main shop menu

On Failure, try to reconnect. Or cancel, which closes the store

When we open the buy adventure menu

On failure, try to reconnect, or cancel, which sloes the buy adventure menu

When we make the purchase:

If it's not initialized, pop up the menu saying we couldn't connect and show the last reason why we couldn't initailize. Give option to try again which calls buy product id, or cancel which closes the dialog
